# Findr

Our purpose is to create a front-end, user friendly, application that allows users to quickly find, store, and share preferred recipes. We know meal planning is a dreaded task as meals quickly become repetitive. We want to give users more variety by making preferred recipes (based on dietary preferences) readily available with a recipe discovery app.
